## Dependency Chain
#55 → #56 → #57 → #58 → #59 (strict sequential order)

## Key Design Decisions to Verify in Phase 1
- Tech stack is "generic" — implementation agent must inspect existing repo files (pom.xml, requirements.txt, package.json) to confirm language/framework before proceeding.
- File storage: local filesystem path from env var (MVP); can be upgraded to S3/GCS later.
- Status transitions: DRAFT → OPEN → CLOSED (no backwards transitions unless explicitly requested).
- Auth/RBAC: NOT in scope for this MVP. Recruiter vs Candidate roles are conceptual actor labels, not enforced by auth middleware.
- Email uniqueness per job: NOT enforced (assumption — awaiting user clarification).
- No pagination required in MVP.

## Milestones Created
- M1: Setup & Scaffolding (number: 1, due: 2025-07-21)
- M2: Core Implementation (number: 2, due: 2025-08-04)
- M3: Testing & Review (number: 6, due: 2025-08-11)
- M4: Documentation & Deployment (number: 7, due: 2025-08-18)

## Labels Created
setup, implementation, testing, documentation, autonomous-dev, priority:critical, priority:high, priority:medium, priority:low

## Project Rules Reminders
- Never delete/overwrite files without user confirmation
- Every service/utility must have a corresponding unit test file
- All endpoints need input validation + structured error responses
- Use only libraries already in existing build file
- No hardcoded secrets — env vars only
- Conventional Commits format
- DB changes must include migration scripts
- Maintain AGENTS.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md throughout
