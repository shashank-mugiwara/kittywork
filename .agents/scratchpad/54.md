# Kittywork MVP — Issue #54 Planning Notes

## Sub-Issues Created
| # | Title | Milestone | Priority |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|
| #55 | Phase 1: Setup & Bootstrapping | M1: Setup & Scaffolding | critical |
| #56 | Phase 2: Core Implementation — Domain Models, Services & API Endpoints | M2: Core Implementation | critical |
| #57 | Phase 3: Integration & Connections — Database, File Storage & End-to-End Wiring | M2: Core Implementation | high |
| #58 | Phase 4: Tests & Quality — Unit, Integration Tests & Linting | M3: Testing & Review | high |
| #59 | Phase 5: Documentation — README, AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md & Usage Examples | M4: Documentation & Deployment | medium |

## Dependency Chain
#55 → #56 → #57 → #58 → #59 (strict sequential order)

## Key Design Decisions to Verify in Phase 1
- Tech stack is "generic" — implementation agent must inspect existing repo files (pom.xml, requirements.txt, package.json) to confirm language/framework before proceeding.
- File storage: local filesystem path from env var (MVP); can be upgraded to S3/GCS later.
- Status transitions: DRAFT → OPEN → CLOSED (no backwards transitions unless explicitly requested).
- Auth/RBAC: NOT in scope for this MVP. Recruiter vs Candidate roles are conceptual actor labels, not enforced by auth middleware.

## Project Rules Reminders
- Never delete/overwrite files without user confirmation
- Every service/utility must have a corresponding unit test file
- All endpoints need input validation + structured error responses
- Use only libraries already in existing build file
- No hardcoded secrets — env vars only
- Conventional Commits format
- DB changes must include migration scripts
- Maintain AGENTS.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md throughout
