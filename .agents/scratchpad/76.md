# Issue #76 — Dollar Budget Test Planning Notes

## Status: PLANNING COMPLETE — awaiting `/approve`

## Budget
- Initial budget: **$2.00** (as specified in requirements)
- Agent recommended budget: **$2.50** (moderate 5-phase scope)
- Test: user will run `/budget 3.00` to validate the budget update command

## Sub-Issues Created (proposed)
1. Phase 1 — Setup & Bootstrapping → M1 (P: critical, due 2025-07-28)
2. Phase 2 — Core Implementation → M2 (P: critical, due 2025-08-04)
3. Phase 3 — Integration & Connections → M2 (P: high, due 2025-08-04)
4. Phase 4 — Tests & Quality → M3 (P: high, due 2025-08-11)
5. Phase 5 — Documentation → M4 (P: medium, due 2025-08-18)

## Dependency Order
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 (strict sequential)

## Key Decisions & Assumptions
- Tech stack is "generic" — no specific framework detected; implementation will adapt to existing stack
- Budget values must be sourced from environment variables (e.g. `DEFAULT_BUDGET_USD=2.00`)
- The `/budget` command parsing and budget state management are the core deliverables
- AGENTS.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md must be updated per project rules

## Project Rules in Effect
- Never delete existing files without confirmation
- Every new service/utility → unit test file
- All REST endpoints → input validation + structured errors
- Only use existing declared dependencies
- No hardcoded secrets/credentials
- Conventional Commits format
- DB schema changes → migration script
- No new global state/singletons
- Maintain AGENTS.md at repo root
- Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for new domains/layers
